# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn using various machine learning models. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and iteration for improvement.

## Data

The dataset includes customer information such as:

- Account length
- Area code
- International plan
- Voice mail plan
- Various call and charge metrics
- Customer service call counts
- Churn status

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Correlation Heatmap

A heatmap was created to visualize the correlation between features. High correlations (red) indicate strong relationships between features. For instance, `total monthly charges` and `total day minutes` showed a strong positive correlation.

### Pairplot

A pairplot showed the distribution of `total day minutes`, `total evening minutes`, and `total night minutes` with churn status as the hue. The analysis revealed different usage patterns for churned and non-churned customers.

### Boxplots

Boxplots indicated that higher customer service call counts and total monthly charges are associated with higher churn rates. Outliers in these plots suggest significant dissatisfaction leading to churn.

### Pie Chart

A pie chart displayed the distribution of customers by international plan, with over 90% not having the plan. This suggests a potential focus area for the company.

## Feature Engineering

Key features created:

- **total calls**: Sum of day, evening, and night calls.
- **call_day_night_ratio**: Ratio of day to night calls.
- **total_charge_per_day_min**: Average charge per day minute.
- **customer_service_calls_per_year**: Annualized customer service calls.
- **total_monthly_charges**: Sum of all monthly charges.

## Modeling

### Baseline Model (Logistic Regression)

The baseline model using logistic regression provided the following performance metrics:

- **Accuracy:** 84.9%
- **Precision:** 0.0
- **Recall:** 0.0
- **F1 Score:** 0.0
- **ROC AUC Score:** 0.5
- **Confusion Matrix:**
