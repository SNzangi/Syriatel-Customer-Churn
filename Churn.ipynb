    "The telecommunications industry is fiercely competitive, with customers having numerous service providers to choose from.  High customer churn, the rate at which subscribers discontinue service, is a significant challenge. The average annual churn rate in this industry ranges from 15% to 25%, making customer retention a top priority.  Acquiring new customers is roughly 5 to 10 times more expensive than retaining existing ones, highlighting the importance of keeping current subscribers satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "To effectively reduce churn, telecom companies need to proactively identify customers at high risk of leaving. Common causes of churn include poor customer service, inadequate products, and unfavorable pricing plans. Losing customers can have serious consequences, including increased costs for customer acquisition and product development, a decline in referrals, and a reduced Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).\n",

    "In today's challenging economic climate, with rising interest rates, inflation, and an uncertain job market, addressing customer churn is even more critical for telecommunications companies.\n",
